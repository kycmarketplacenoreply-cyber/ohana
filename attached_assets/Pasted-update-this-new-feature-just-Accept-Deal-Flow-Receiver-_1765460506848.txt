0ne the deal is succeful receiver esrow fund should be deducte and creditrd to loader account if for example upfront was 100 usd and receiver have 120 usd in escrow maybe 20 is for other open trades,when the deal is succeful or settle by admin 100 usd will be deducted and 20 usd remain if he stills have other orders ,100 goes to loader wallet fees goes to admin wallet always ensure once the deal is success loaders ccolletaral should be credited back to their wallet from esrow and the 3% fess go to platform fee (admin wallet )not credited to their wallet
